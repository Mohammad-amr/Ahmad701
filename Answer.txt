// Assume you have an Exam object called exam and a list of Answer objects called studentAnswers

// Get all the correct answers for this exam
var correctAnswers = exam.Questions.SelectMany(q => q.Answers.Where(a => a.IsCorrect));

// Get all the correct answers that the student selected
var correctStudentAnswers = studentAnswers.Where(sa => sa.IsCorrect);

// Calculate the student's grade as a percentage
double grade = ((double)correctStudentAnswers.Count() / (double)correctAnswers.Count()) * 100;
